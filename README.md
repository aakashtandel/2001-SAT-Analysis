### Overview

This project goes over very basic summary statistics and exploratory data analysis. The data is from the College Board's SAT test (from 2001) organized by math and verbal scores. I attempt to showcase the very basics of data visualization and statistical analysis with this project. The exploratory data analysis utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Tableau.
